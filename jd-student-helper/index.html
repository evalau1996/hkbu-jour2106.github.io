                <h2> Course Introduction </h2>

                <p>
                    As data becomes increasingly important in news reporting, this course helps students learn the fundamental principles, tools and workflow to visualise data. Each class is composed of half lecture session and half lab session so that students can get adequate
                    guided exercises. The course mainly focuses on data visualisation although it covers basic data analytics and data journalism workflow just to be self-contained. Among many visualisation techniques and tools, this course focuses on
                    the web stack, because most content are distributed via (mobile) web-based technology at present. Students will learn the end-to-end production and deployment of a web-based story, foundations of HTML/CSS/Javascript and visualisation
                    libraries like
                    <a href="https://github.com/ecomfe/echarts">eCharts</a>,
                    <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3">D3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet">Leaflet</a>, ... By finishing this course, students are expected to build one web-based data visualisation news story and distribute the project
                    via their own websites.
                </p>
